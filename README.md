Simple language learning page. Given a list of words and their translations will present them to you flashcard-style. I use it in combination with [New Tab Override](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-tab-override/) so I get a random word every time I open a new page.

By default this comes with some common Spanish words, but just replace docs/spanish.json with whatever you like. To do so, just update data and run `generate.rb`.
